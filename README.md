Answers to questions:

1. If I were to add test scenarios to the Jupiter App, I would include the following:
	a. test cases for log in functionality
	b. test cases for checking the records of the added feedback if it is correct
	c. test cases for checking out the cart
	d. test cases for tracking the order
	
2. To reduce overall execution time, I would implement the spring boot framework and also enable doing parallel runs.

3. I have used Cucumber BDD framework in the last 3 years and I can say that there are a lot of steps that are difficult to cover using Gherkin steps.
It can be difficult to parameterize, to pass values in between steps and to iterate steps inside the test scenario. If the application requires dynamic steps,
BDD is not the best option.
